# # WTF am i trying to do?
# - I am trying to generate data for my experiment that i can analyze later
#   using various
#   - parametric statistics (sd, t-test, anova, general linear mixed model)
#   - a power analysis,


# - generate data for each person, so i need parameters of  
#   - person, mean offset on the x and y, the standard deviations of them 
#   - their height, their wingspan (for a general linear mixed model)
#   - id need angles of the perosons hand and joints in space basically
